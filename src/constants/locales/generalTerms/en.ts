        <li>The other party of the service provider is referred to as the client in these general terms and conditions. </li>

        title: 'Article 3 - Payment',
        text: `<ol>
        <li>Invoices must be paid within 14 days of the invoice date unless the parties have made other
        arrangements in writing, or a different payment term is stated on the invoice.</li> 
        <li> Payments are made without any appeal to suspension or settlement by transfer of the amount due
        to the bank account number specified by the service provider.</li> 
        <li> If the client does not pay an invoice within the agreed term, it will be in default by operation of law,
            without any reminder being required, and a penalty interest clause of 1.0% per day on the amount
        owed will apply. From that moment on, the service provider is also entitled to suspend the obligations
        until the client has fulfilled its payment obligations.</li> 
        <li> If the client remains in default, the service provider will proceed with collection. The costs related to
        collection are for the account of the client. If the client is in default, in addition to the principal sum,
            he also owes statutory (commercial) interest, extrajudicial collection costs, and other damage to the
        service provider. The collection costs are calculated based on the “Decree on compensation for
            extrajudicial collection costs”.</li>

        claims of the service provider against the client are immediately due and payable.</li>

        fully obliged to pay the agreed price to the service provider.</li>

        different term of acceptance is stated in the offer. If the offer is not accepted within that term, the
        offer will lapse.</li>
        <li> Delivery times in quotations are indicative and, if they are exceeded, do not entitle the client to
        dissolution or compensation, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in writing.</li>

        and any other government levies unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
        <li> The prices of services are based on the cost prices known at that time. Increases thereof, which
        could not have been foreseen by the service provider at the time of making the offer or the conclusion
        of the agreement, may give rise to price increases.</li>
        <li> Regarding the service, the parties can agree on a fixed price when the agreement is concluded.</li>
        <li> If no fixed price has been agreed, the rate regarding the service can be determined based on the
        hours spent. The rate is calculated according to the service provider's usual hourly rates, applicable
        for the period in which he performs the work, unless a different hourly rate has been agreed.</li>
        <li> If no rate has been agreed based on the hours spent, a target price will be agreed for the service,
            whereby the service provider is entitled to deviate from this up to 10%. If the target price is more than
        10% higher, the service provider must inform the client in good time why a higher price is justified. In
        that case, the client has the right to cancel a part of the order that exceeds the target price plus 10%.</li>

        in writing.</li>
        <li> If the parties have agreed on a term for the completion of certain work within the term of the

        in the fulfillment of any obligation towards the client cannot be attributed to the service provider, in
        the event of a circumstance independent of the will of the service provider, as a result of which the
        fulfillment of his obligations towards the client is wholly or partially prevented or where the
        fulfillment of his obligations cannot reasonably be expected of the service provider”. These

        has caused the damage intentionally or with gross negligence.</li>
        <li> If the service provider owes compensation to the client, the damage will not exceed the fee.</li>
        <li> Any liability for damage arising from or related to the execution of an agreement is always limited to
        the amount paid out in the relevant case by the (professional) liability insurance(s) taken out. This
        amount is increased by the amount of the deductible according to the relevant policy.</li>

    the amounts due to the service provider under that contract.</li>
<li> If an assignment is given directly or indirectly by a natural person on behalf of a legal person, this
natural person can also be a private client. This requires that this natural person can be regarded as
    the (co-)policymaker of the legal person. In the event of non-payment by the legal person, the natural
person is therefore personally liable for the payment of the invoice, irrespective of whether it is,
    whether at the request of the client, in the name of a legal person, or in the name of the client as a
natural person or both.</li>

encumber them in any other way.</li>
